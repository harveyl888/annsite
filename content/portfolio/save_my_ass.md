## SAVE MY ASS MOBILE APP

I was approached by a client to help develop an idea for a texting app. 
The idea grew from the fact that there are many instances when you need to write a text, or respond to a text and you have absolutely no idea what to say. With this app, now you donâ€™t need to think or stress about anything. All of the work is done for you.

With a team of creatives I developed the app from concept to finish including naming of the app, initial wire frames, user journey, creative content and branding/PR across multiple platforms in the digital and social media space.

The app's main purpose was to serve as functional entertainment helping adults communicate effectively through texting.

Features include:

-  18 witty categories featuring over 1500 texts that can be sent as is or personalized by the user.
-  Want to spice things up? The "talk dirty to me" category includes clever banter from romantic to sexy.
-  Need an alibi? Log in, choose the "alibi" feature, write a text to cover your tracks and choose a friend from your contact list as your "alibi." Hit "send" and the text will be sent simultaneously to the recipient and your "alibi" ensuring your whereabouts are "confirmed."
