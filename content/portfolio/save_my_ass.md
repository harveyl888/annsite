## SAVE MY ASS MOBILE APP

We were approached to help develop an idea that a client had for a texting app.  
The idea came from the fact that there are many instances when you need to write a text, or respond to a text and you don’t know what to say. With this app, now you don’t need to think or stress about anything. All of the work is done for you.

We developed the app from concept to finish including naming of the app, initial wire frames, user journey, creative content and branding/PR across multiple platforms in the digital and social media space.

The apps main purpose was to serve as "functional entertainment".
