## FLIP.COM

CondeNet, a division of CondeNaste was launching a brand new social network for girls called "Flip.com" allowing girls creative expression by creating their very own "Flipbooks". The girls could also create personality profiles and make friends through viral communication. We were charged with launching this brand new property and finding the next "MySpace".

For launch we identified teen and celebrity "influencers" and created "Flip Intro Kits" that included a small book and "Mimobot" USB keys which we concepted and designed that were loaded with exclusive assets â€“ pictures, music and videos that girls could use on the site.

A unique tin was created and mailed out to teen girls / celebs that had been indentified as "influencers".

A welcome message was the first thing that was seen when opening the box.

The box contained a uniquely designed Mimobot (USB key) loaded with assets.

There was also a book included in the box that profiled 3 teen girls who were also Flip users and talked about all the cool stuff you could do on the site.

The book also offered suggestions of the kind of "flipbooks" girls could create.

When you plugged your USB key into your computer, this is the home page that came up. It directed the girls to look for exclusive content such as music videos, stickers and pictures they could upload to their flipbook pages.
