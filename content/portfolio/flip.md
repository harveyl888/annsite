## FLIP.COM

CondeNet, a division of CondeNaste was launching a brand new social network for girls called "Flip.com" allowing girls creative expression by creating their very own "Flipbooks". The girls could also create personality profiles and make friends through viral communication. We were charged with launching this brand new property and finding the next "MySpace".

For launch we identified teen and celebrity "influencers" and created "Flip Intro Kits" that included a small book and "Mimobot" USB keys which we concepted and designed that were loaded with exclusive assets â€“ pictures, music and videos that girls could use on the site.
