## THE CHILDREN'S PLACE
### Agency: Mother, New York


### Celebrate the World of Kid

The Childrenâ€™s Place is a leading retailer for kids, toddlers and babies in the US. They have adorable fashions at affordable prices. We created a branding campaign with the line, "Celebrate the World of Kid" and did just that. We captured kids doing what they do best ... being their weird, wonderful, wacky selves.  For our print and out of home campaign we worked with German photographer Achim Lippoth as he truly captured the essence of childhood by taking amazing portraits.
