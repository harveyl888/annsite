## MILLER LITE / DRIZLY

### Amazon Alexa Skill

"Alexa, it’s Miller Time." Miller Lite jumped on the Alexa train and wanted to give lazy beer drinkers the option to order Miller Lite with a simple voice command.

I was challenged with enabling this new Alexa skill and concepted and executed all copy to make this happen. This covered downloading the app, installing the skill and taking the user through the process of ordering beer. I also was tasked with writing entertaining dialogue for Alexa to say to the user when prompted.

Alexa responses to: "Alexa, it’s Miller Time" or "Alexa, Can you order me Miller Lite?"

Of course I can. That’s why they pay me the big bucks.

I’ve been waiting all week for you to say that. On it.

I love Miller Time! (she plays 5 secs of a party song) What a perfect way to end the week. Any chance we could fly to Cabo too?
