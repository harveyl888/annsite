## ALEXA, IT'S MILLER TIME

"Alexa, it’s Miller Time." MillerCoors jumped on the Alexa train and wanted to give lazy beer drinkers the option to order Miller Lite with a simple voice command.

I was challenged with enabling this new Alexa skill and concepted and executed all copy to make this happen. This covered downloading the app, to installing the skill to actually taking the user through the process of ordering beer. I also was tasked with writing entertaining dialogue for Alexa to say to the user when prompted.

The delivery requests are fulfilled within one hour with a partnership with Drizly, an online alcohol delivery service. All copy was also written to guide users to set up their Drizly account if they didn’t have one already.

Some Alexa responses to, “Alexa, it’s Miller Time.”  
Of course I can. That’s why they pay me the big bucks.  
I’ve been waiting all week for you to say that. On it.  
No problem. I’m highly skilled at ordering beer.  
I love Miller Time! (she plays 5 secs of a party song from your Amazon Music) 
Yes. Perfect way to end the week. Any chance we could fly to Cabo too?  
Sure. I’ll order right away. Should I make room in the fridge too? Ha ha.
