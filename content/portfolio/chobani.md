## CHAMPLIFY MOBILE APP

The challenge was to create a new interactive digital campaign for Chobani yogurt's "Chobani Champions" line, which is "the first Greek yogurt made for kids."  

The Champlify Mobile App allowed parents and children to share an online experience with activities related to "Champion" qualities: Imaginative, Active, Courageous and Caring, unlocking trophies and rewards along the way. This campaign also included a collectable ChampTag underneath Chobani Champions lids of the actual yogurt. Each tag contained a unique AR code that came to life in 3-D.
