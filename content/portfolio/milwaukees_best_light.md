## MILWAUKEE'S BEST LIGHT

### Can Crush Campaign
What better way to punish unmanly behavior than to crush a man with a giant beer can?  This campaign debuted during The World Series of Poker on ESPN and took the world by storm.  It won {{<bold txt="One Show Bronze">}} and continued for years encompassing nearly 20 commercials.

### Can Crush Spectacular
These billboard ads were created to run along side our can crushing TV spots. We created fake billboards fo "un-manly" products and services that ran in high traffic areas for a couple of weeks. Then, overnight, the boards were seamlessly changed over so the next morning they appeared "crushed" by a giant beer can.

### Brewed For A Man's Taste
These were print and out of home ads that reinforced the positioning that Milwaukee's Best Light was "Brewed for a Man’s Taste".

### Playboy Print
 How do you stand out in Playboy? We wanted to freshen up our "Brewed for a Man’s Taste" campaign and go beyond mere airbrushed models. We decided to use pure illustration in order to have more fun with the idea. The images were intended to be a guy's ultimate fantasy intended to look like classic Americana T-shirt art, and the 'wink' in each ad is emphasized by a cliché.

 ### Milwaukee’s Best On-Line
 We created a brand new site for Milwaukee's Best Light to go along with our can crushing/manliness there. In addition to a timeline of "Man Moments" and a collection of downloadable pinups, the site included some surprisingly difficult games in which users try to ogle a friend's sister without getting caught, attempt to not dance to Top 40, and struggle to hold back the tears after watching a sad movie with the guys.
