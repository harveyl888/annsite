## THE BOSTON CELTICS

### Spec Campaign

The late 90's were tough for the Boston Celtics. They missed out on Tim Duncan in the 1997 draft and new coach Rick Pitino had to settle for Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The Celtics organization was looking for a "pick-me-up" and needed to sell more tickets.  
We created full page, color ads to run in the Boston Globe, harkening back to the glory days of Celtics greatness. These long copy ads were intended to evoke nostalgia and be collectable posters.
