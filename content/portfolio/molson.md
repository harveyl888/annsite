## "IT'S GREAT TO BE CANADIAN"

The challenge was to come up with some spectacular ways to support the campaign, "Itâ€™s Great to Be Canadian". Because being from Canada means more than breathtaking lakes, moose, Mounties and Bryan Adams.

We created POS pieces, on-site, in liquor stores by giving away coolers that were wrapped to look like the 6-pack of Molson was stuck in a block of ice. The campaign also extended to bars and featured branded mirrors and branded walls in bathrooms.
