## "WE FEEL YOUR PAIN"

We created a print and viral digital campaign sympathizing with mom's letting them know, "We feel your pain". Design wise, we connected a specific pain with Motrin by writing words like  "high heels" , "baby carriers"  and "30 lb stroller" right on the Motrin pill.

### 30 lb Stroller
