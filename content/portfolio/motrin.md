## Motrin

### Agency: Taxi, New York

### We Feel Your Pain

We created a print and digital campaign connecting with moms, sympathizing with them and letting them know "We feel your pain".  The creative work connected specific things that can cause pain and that could be relieved with Motrin. Pain points such as aching feet from wearing high heels and back pain from wearing a baby carrier. This campaign was real and appealed to the emotions of moms everywhere.
