## Blue Q

### Agency: Mother, New York

Blue Q is a company out of Pittsfield, Massachusetts that are "proud designers and manufacturers of life-improving, joy-bringing products since 1988." We were challenged with a few things, first to promote the brand to the general public, and second, to invent some original products that they could sell.

### Blue Q Sales team

As self-proclaimed “manufacturers of curiosities” we helped BlueQ manufacture a campaign that is also a curiosity. It was a really fun way to spend $5000 production dollars back in the day.   

The Blue Q Sales Team sure knows how to sell products. We created a site showcasing this remarkable ability.

The internet was pretty basic at the time, hence the microsite. Visitors chose which sales pitch they wanted (A babe or A hunk) based on their sexual preference. Personally, I like the hunk. Especially THIS hunk. And just to be fair and transparent, I've also included the babe.

### Pre-Rolls

We also made a bunch of ridiculous pre-roll videos that sold specific products in their line.

### "Could You Be A Bigger Bitch" Gum

I created a novelty gum that could be handed out to any coworker who you don’t like. Simply leave this on their desk and they’ll be sure to get the super-obvious hint.  
Front:  "Could you be a bigger bitch?"  
Back:  "Seriously, I really hate you."

### Blue Q Post Cards

We wanted to do an awareness campaign that showcased the ridiculousness of the BlueQ brand. We created these fun postcards that were printed and strategically placed in high traffic locations.
