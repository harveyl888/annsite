## Blue Q Sales team

Blue Q is a company out of Pittsfield, Massachusetts that are "proud designers and manufacturers of life-improving, joy-bringing products since 1988." We were challenged with a few things, first to promote the brand to the general public, and second, to invent some original products that they could sell.  

The Blue Q Sales Team sure knows how to sell products. We created a site showcasing this remarkable ability.

Users were able to choose who should pitch to them - a Babe or a Hunk - based on sexual preference. Personally, I like the Hunk. Especially THIS hunk. The pre-roll for these products were equally hot. And just to be fair, I've also included the one of the Babe.

If the user was into hunky men, they were given this sales pitch.

Or if the user was into babes, this is what they saw.

### "Could You Be A Bigger Bitch" Gum

I created a novelty gum that you can hand out to any coworker who might not be so nice. Leave this on their desk and they'll be sure to get the hint.  
Front:  "Could you be a bigger bitch?"  
Back:  "Seriously, I really hate you."  
You can buy this gum at numerous retailers on-line including Amazon. Happy chewing.

### Blue Q Post Cards

Post cards were created and distributed promoting already existing BlueQ products and overall branding.
