## PROGRESSIVE

Progressive wanted to promote their "Name Your Price Tool" by co-branding a TV spot with the summer blockbuster, "Ghostbusters". We shot with Mr. Paul Feig who also directed the new, Ghostbusters movie. Flo has played many parts over her long history with Progressive but has never appeared as a ghost ... until now. This spot aired throughout the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.
