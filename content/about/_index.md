Writer of freelance copy. Cultivator of small humans. Documenter of suburban crazy. I'm a mini-van driving mother of 3 married to a sexy Brit bringing 20+ years of advertising knowledge to the table. I've worked at some hot-shit shops on a wide range of clients from concept to finish. I do pitches, fully integrated campaigns, digital, social, branding and everything in between. For fun I cook, think about learning to play the guitar and have a gazillion side projects that are all super creative ideas that Iâ€™ve started but not finished, in addition to my two blogs which I never write on any more. If you need bold, creative conceptual ideas, witty headlines, trending hashtags, TikTok content, Insta Post, a Tweet or an amazing sitcom idea, let's talk.
