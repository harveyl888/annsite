I'm an ACD/Copywriter and totally suburban mother-of-3 married to a sexy Brit. I’ve been in "the biz" for 17 years working at some hot-shit shops on a wide range of clients from concept to finish, running pitches, fully integrated campaigns and everything in between. There is never a dull moment looking after my kids, affectionately known as "the 3 assholes". For fun I cook and have a gazillion side projects I’ve started but not finished, in addition to my two blogs.
